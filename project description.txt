to change the project into following liked user - 
    1. change the userProfileLink to the user's like page url.
    2. check if the first post is a reply liked or simple liked
    3. use the hover effect on first user. ( if simple liked )
    4. follow if not followed.
    5. move to the next user ( delete or use list ).
    ( will have to figure out if it would render as the page is not scrolling);


after going to like page.
    find all the post using queryselector
    // follow/not follow users check if it is a reply first.
    
    after all post is done. delete all the post and scroll down using some javascript and repeat
